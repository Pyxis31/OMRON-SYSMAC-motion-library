# OMRON-SYSMAC-motion-library
A library to manage real time cams with multiple segments and multiple profiles (Straight, poly3 and poly5). Automatic calculation of the segments linking (speed coefficient only). Infinite (modulo) or reciprocal slave profiles management. Master switchable between internal axis or external position. On-the-fly profile change. Warmstart to recover the position of the slave after a disconnection. Disconnection of the slave with a speed linear regression. Slave starting from null speed and tracking a master in continuous movement (ex. a conveyor). Polynomial moves (instead of MC_MOVE) for achieving synchronised movements (made by distance + time). Starting and Ending Edges of moves, settled by timers, to chain movements and so that create for instance, corners on XY trajectory (XY table). Some Standard PLCopen function blocs embedded within the library for simplifying the application writing code.
